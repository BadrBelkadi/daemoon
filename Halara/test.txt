## Impact

An attacker can craft a malicious page that, when visited by a logged-in Halara user, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's session. Since the `token_29` session cookie is accessible via JavaScript, the attacker can silently exfiltrate it to a server they control, then replay it to fully impersonate the victim. This grants the attacker complete access to the victim's account — including viewing personal information, saved addresses, order history, and stored payment methods. The vulnerability affects all 11 regional Halara domains, meaning a single malicious link works across all geolocations with no modification.
